## Overview

This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to the Stanford Dogs dataset for two main tasks: center locating of dog images and breed identification. We implemented several algorithms, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to evaluate their performance on these tasks. The project's methodology, experimental setup, and results are documented in detail in the accompanying report.


## Implementation

This project implements the following methods:

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Linear Regression (including Ridge Regression)
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The main script (`main.py`) executes these models on the Stanford Dogs dataset and evaluates their performance based on accuracy and mean squared error (MSE).


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques on the Stanford Dogs dataset. Detailed results and findings are available in the accompanying project report (report.pdf).
